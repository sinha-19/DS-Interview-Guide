# 15. Memory Management & Garbage Collection

---

## What is Memory Management?

Memory management refers to the techniques and processes used by programs and operating systems to handle computer memory. Itâ€™s essential for performance, reliability, and avoiding errors like memory leaks or buffer overflows.

## Memory Segments

- **Stack:** Stores function call data, local variables. Managed automatically; fast but limited in size.
- **Heap:** Dynamically allocated memory; must be managed by programmer or garbage collector.
- **Data Segment:** Global/static variables.
- **Text Segment:** Program code.

## Stack vs Heap

| Stack                    | Heap                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Fast allocation/deletion | Slower allocation         |
| Managed automatically    | Manual/automatic (GC)     |
| Limited size             | Usually larger            |
| Grows/shrinks automatically | Explicit management    |

### Example (C):

```c
void foo() {
    int a = 5; // Stack allocation
    int* ptr = malloc(sizeof(int)); // Heap allocation
    *ptr = 10;
    free(ptr); // Must free manually!
}
```

## Manual Memory Management

#### Languages: C, C++

- Use `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free` in C.
- Use `new`, `delete` in C++.
- Programmer must keep track of resource lifetimes.

#### Dangers

- **Memory Leak:** Allocated memory not freed.
- **Dangling Pointer:** Accessing freed memory.
- **Double Free:** Freeing the same pointer twice.
- **Buffer Overflow:** Writing past array bounds.

---

## Automatic Memory Management

#### Languages: Java, Python, Go, C#.

- Rely on a **Garbage Collector (GC)** to reclaim unused memory.

### Garbage Collection Algorithms

1. **Reference Counting:** Objects are freed when reference count drops to zero.
   - Fast, but cannot handle cycles.
2. **Mark and Sweep:** Mark all reachable objects, sweep unmarked.
3. **Generational GC:** Separate objects by age; collect young ones frequently.

#### Example (Python):

```python
class MyClass:
    pass
a = MyClass()
b = a
del a  # b still references object
del b  # Now object is eligible for GC
```

## Smart Pointers (C++)

- **Unique Pointer (`std::unique_ptr`)**: Sole ownership, auto-deletes.
- **Shared Pointer (`std::shared_ptr`)**: Reference counting.
- **Weak Pointer (`std::weak_ptr`)**: Non-owning, avoids cycles.

---

## Memory Management Best Practices

- Always free memory after use (in manual languages).
- Use smart pointers to avoid leaks (C++).
- Avoid global/static variables unless necessary.
- Minimize object retention in managed languages (break references).
- Profile and analyze memory usage (Valgrind, LeakSanitizer, JVM profilers).

## Common Interview Questions

- What is a memory leak? How to detect/avoid?
- Difference between stack and heap? When to use each?
- How does GC work in Java/Python/C#?
- What is a dangling pointer? How to avoid?
- What are smart pointers?

## Tools for Memory Management

- **Valgrind:** Memory debugging, leak detection (C/C++).
- **GDB:** Debugger for low-level memory analysis.
- **Java VisualVM, JProfiler:** Java memory analysis.
- **Python `gc` module:** Exposure for manual GC tuning.
