# 17. Best Practices & Interview Q&A

---

## General Coding Best Practices

- **Clarity First:** Write code that is easy to read and understand.
- **Modularity:** Break code into functions or classes with clear purposes.
- **Naming:** Use descriptive variable and function names.
- **Edge Cases:** Always handle nulls, empty inputs, single elements, large values, etc.
- **Testing:** Test with sample and edge case inputs.
- **Comments:** Use comments to explain non-obvious logic, but not trivial lines.
- **Avoid Magic Numbers:** Use named constants.
- **Consistent Style:** Follow PEP8 (Python) or language-specific style guides.

## Interview Preparation Tips

1. **Clarify the Problem:** Restate in your own words, ask clarifying questions.
2. **Think Aloud:** Communicate your approach and reasoning.
3. **Start Simple:** Implement brute-force or naive solutions first.
4. **Optimize:** Once correct, discuss and implement optimizations.
5. **Draw Diagrams:** Visualize data structures, test cases, and pointer movement.
6. **Test on Paper:** Before running, walk through your code with sample inputs.
7. **Know Your Complexities:** Analyze and state time/space complexity.
8. **Be Honest:** If stuck, acknowledge and discuss possible approaches.

  - Sliding window maximum
- **Trees/Graphs:**
  - Binary tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)
  - Lowest Common Ancestor
  - Serialize/Deserialize binary tree
  - Graph traversal (BFS/DFS)
- **Design:**
  - LRU cache
  - Design a parking lot or file system
