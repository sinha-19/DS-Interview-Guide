# 1. Introduction to Data Structures

## What are Data Structures?

A **data structure** is a specialized way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently for various operations.

---

## Why are Data Structures Important?

- **Efficiency:** Choosing the right data structure optimizes time and space complexity.
- **Code Clarity:** Makes code easier to read, maintain, and debug.
- **Foundation of Algorithms:** Many algorithms rely on appropriate data structures.

---

## Types of Data Structures

### 1. Linear Data Structures
- **Array:** Collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked List:** Sequence of nodes where each node points to the next.
- **Stack:** Follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queue:** Follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Tree:** Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships (e.g., Binary Tree, BST, AVL).
- **Graph:** Set of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them.

### 3. Hash-Based Structures
- **Hash Table/Map:** Key-value pairs with (ideally) constant time access.

### 4. Advanced & Other Structures
- **Heap:** Specialized tree for priority access.
- **Trie:** Prefix tree for efficient string retrieval.
- **Segment/Fenwick Tree:** For range queries and updates.
- **Disjoint Set/Union-Find:** For partitioning a set into disjoint subsets.

## Data Structure Operations

- **Insertion:** Add an element.
- **Deletion:** Remove an element.
- **Traversal:** Visit all elements.
- **Searching:** Find an element.
- **Updating:** Modify an element.

## Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

An **ADT** defines the logical behavior (operations) of a data structure without specifying implementation.

| ADT         | Operations (Examples)      |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Stack       | push, pop, peek           |
| Queue       | enqueue, dequeue, front   |
| List        | insert, delete, search    |
| Map/Dict    | put, get, remove          |

## Real-World Applications

- Databases (B-trees, Hash Tables)
- Compilers (Syntax Trees, Stacks)
- Networks (Graphs, Queues)
- Operating Systems (Scheduling Queues, Heaps)

---

## Tips for Interviews

- Be able to explain when and why to use a particular data structure.
- Know trade-offs (time/space complexity).
- Practice implementing basic data structures from scratch.

## Common Interview Questions

1. What is a data structure? Why are data structures important?
2. When would you use an array vs. a linked list?
3. What is the difference between a stack and a queue?
4. Explain the concept of an abstract data type (ADT).
